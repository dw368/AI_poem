In the middle of the night
When our hopes and fears collide
In the midst of all goodbyes
Where all human beings lie
Against another lie
Whisper broken promises
There we hide
Try to make it seem alright
What goes around again
We'd be running from the pain
Finding shelter in the rain
Lovers straying seasons changing
Strangers to lovers
What comes around again
You'd fall asleep in my embrace
Steal a kiss on your little face
Would have always been that way
But hey
You're never coming back
Never coming back
I'll be waiting anyway
I'll be waiting anyway
Until the day
In the middle of the night
Lonely souls travel in time
Familiar hearts start to entwine
We imagine what we'll find
In another life
Whisper broken promises
There we hide
Try to make it seem alright
What goes around again
We'd be running from the pain
Finding shelter in the rain
Lovers straying seasons changing
Strangers to lovers
What comes around again
You'd fall asleep in my embrace
Steal a kiss on your little face
Would have always been that way
But hey
You're never coming back
Never coming back
I'll be waiting anyway
I'll be waiting anyway
Till it comes around again
We'd be playing in the sand
Holding hands just one last chance
No more hurts no more goodbyes
We'd dance
We're never going back
Never turning back
Won't you wait with me anyway
Won't you wait with me anyway
Until the day
What comes around goes around
What goes around comes around
Until the day
